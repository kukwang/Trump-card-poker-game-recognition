## Introduction
Detect Trump cards and scoring according to the poker game rule on Jetson Nano in real-time.
We used yolov4 tiny model to detect and classify trump cards.
We trained [darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) model using [Trump card dataset](https://github.com/okmd/playing-card-dataset)
We converted darknet model into ONNX model and optimized it using TensorRT.
